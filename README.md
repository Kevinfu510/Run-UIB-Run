# Run-UIB-Run
A University Group Game Project

## About
An endless runner made in Python(2) with the Pygame Library.
The main file to build from is 'main.py' as the name suggests.
Feel free to use any of the source-code/resources you find in this repo.

All the game resources (visuals, and audio) are from other group members, I (Kevin) was the one who did the programming (backend).

## Controls
[SPACE] to jump, press [SPACE] while in the air to double jump.
[DOWN ARROW KEY] to go down faster (while in the air).
[ESC] after death to retry.

## How to Play
Jump to avoid obstacles, and to obtain coins.
If you don't have enough coins at a checkpoint the gate won't open.

## Plans
 - Revamped graphics/visuals
 - Fix lag issues/stuterring
 - Rework coin algorithm
